## Summary

API Gateway is available as a software installation or a virtualized deployment in Docker containers. API Manager is a licensed product running on top of API Gateway, and has the same deployment options as API Gateway.

The software installation is available on Linux. For more details on supported platforms for software installation, see [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

Docker deployment is supported on Linux. For a summary of the system requirements for a Docker deployment, see [Set up Docker environment](/docs/apim_installation/apigw_containers/docker_scripts_prereqs/).

## New features and enhancements

No new features and enhancements are available in this update.

<!-- Add the new features here -->

## Important changes

It is important, especially when upgrading from an earlier version, to be aware of the following changes in the behavior or operation of the product in this update.

<!-- Use this section to describe any changes in the behavior of the product (as a result of features or fixes), for example, new Java system properties in the jvm.xml file. This section could also be used for any important information that doesn't fit elsewhere. -->

### Filebeat v6.2.2

This update uses Filebeat v6.2.2. Before installing this update, you must delete the Filebeat folder  `/apigateway/tools/filebeat-5.2.0`. When using Filebeat, follow the [official Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/6.6/index.html).

### OpenJDK JRE

API Gateway and API Manager 7.7 and later support OpenJDK JRE, and this update includes Zulu OpenJDK 1.8 JRE instead of Oracle JRE 1.8.

### OpenSSL and FIPS support

This update uses OpenSSL 1.1.1, as OpenSSL 1.0.2 is EOL.

OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not support FIPS, and running API Gateway in FIPS mode is not supported in this update. OpenSSL 3.0 (when available) will support FIPS, and FIPS support will be available again in a future update.

References to FIPS in the documentation will not be removed, but this does not mean that FIPS is still supported and the references should be ignored.

### log4j2 changes

The log4j 2 version has been updated from 2.8.2 to 2.13.2. In addition, the log4j 2 file format has been changed to use yaml format. As a result of this, any customization made to the following files

| Pre May Release | 7.7.0_20200530 Release |
| --- | ----------- |
| $VDISTIR/system/conf/loggers/eventLog.xml | $VDISTIR/system/conf/loggers/eventLog.yaml |
| $VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/ `openTrafficLog.xml | $VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/ `openTrafficLog.yaml |
| $VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/ `topologyLog.xml | $VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/ `topologyLog.yaml |
| $VDISTDIR/system/conf/`log4j2.xml | $VDISTDIR/system/conf/`log4j2.yaml |
| $VDISTDIR/rcplatform/plugin-filter-base/lib/`log4j2.xml| $VDISTDIR/rcplatform/plugin-filter-base/lib/`log4j2.yaml |


* $VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/ `eventLog.xml` 
* $VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/ `openTrafficLog.xml` 
* $VDISTDIR/system/conf/loggers/ `topologyLog.xml`  
* $VDISTDIR/system/conf/`log4j2.xml` 
* $VDISTDIR/rcplatform/plugin-filter-base/lib/`log4j2.xml` 

 will now have to be added in yaml format to the new files

## Deprecated features

<!-- Add features that are deprecated here -->

As part of our software development life cycle we constantly review our API Management offering.

The following capabilities have been deprecated.

### Antivirus scanners

API Gateway already supports the industry standard Internet Content Adaption Protocol (ICAP). From the November 2020 update the following embedded antivirus scanners will be removed:

* McAfee
* Sophos
* Clam AV

Content scanning is still supported using the ICAP filter, which provides out-of-the-box integration with ICAP-capable servers provided by Symantec, McAfee, OPSWAT and others, promoting ease of deployment and operational control.

## Removed features

<!-- Add features that are removed here -->

To stay current and align our offerings with customer demand and best practices, Axway might discontinue support for some capabilities. As part of this review, no capabilities have been removed.

## Update a classic (non-container) deployment

These instructions apply to API Gateway and API Manager classic deployments only. For container deployments, see [Update a container deployment](#update-a-container-deployment).

### Prerequisites

This update has the following prerequisites in addition to the [System requirements](/docs/apim_installation/apigtw_install/system_requirements/).

1. Shut down any Node Manager or API Gateway instances on your existing installation.
2. Back up your existing installation. For details on backing up, see [API Gateway backup and disaster recovery](/docs/apim_administration/apigtw_admin/manage_operations/#api-gateway-backup-and-disaster-recovery). Ensure that you back up any customized files. You should merge updated files instead of copying them back directly to avoid any regex matching issues. For example, the following directories might contain customized files:

   ```
   webapps/apiportal/vordel/apiportal
   webapps/emc/vordel/manager/app
   webapps/emc
   system/conf/apiportal/email
   system/conf
   samples/scripts/
   tools/filebeat-VERSION-PLATFORM
   ```
3. Remove old third-party libraries by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/system/lib/modules
   INSTALL_DIR/analytics/system/lib/modules
   ```
4. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the following directories:

   ```
   INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/platform/jre
   ```
5. If you have an existing Apache Cassandra installation, ensure that you back up your data (Cassandra and `kpsadmin`), and that the `JAVA_HOME` variable is set correctly in `cassandra.in.sh` and `cassandra.in.bat`.
6. Remove the old Filebeat folder `/apigateway/tools/filebeat-5.2.0`. Check any customized files to see if they are compatible with the new version. See [Filebeat](#filebeat-v6-2-2) for more information.
7. On Linux, remove existing capabilities on product binaries (which might prevent overwriting files):

   ```
   setcap -r INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/platform/bin/vshell
   ```

### FIPS mode only

If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Run `togglefips --disable` to turn FIPS mode off.
2. Start the Node Manager to move the JARs.
3. Stop the Node Manager.
4. Install the API Gateway update as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.
5. Start the Node Manager.

In Policy Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Policy Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Policy Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Policy Studio using the `policystudio -clean` command.

In Configuration Studio, If FIPS mode is enabled, you must also perform the following steps to install the update:

1. Open Configuration Studio and select **Window > Preferences**.
2. Select the **FIPS Mode** setting.
3. Deselect the **Enable FIPS Mode in Axway Configuration Studio** option and click **OK**.
4. Restart Configuration Studio using the `configurationstudio -clean` command.

### Installation

This section describes how to install the update on existing 7.7 installations of API Gateway or API Manager.

* If you have installed an existing version of API Manager, installing the API Gateway server update automatically also installs the updates and fixes for API Manager.
* If you have installed a licensed version of API Gateway or API Manager 7.7, you do not require a new license to install updates.

#### Install the API Gateway server update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway 7.7 server installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Remove any previous patches from your `INSTALL_DIR/ext/lib` and `INSTALL_DIR/META-INF` directories (or the `ext/lib` directory in an API Gateway instance). These patches have already been included in this update. You do not need to copy patches from a previous version.
3. Verify the owners of API Gateway binaries before extracting the update.

   ```
   ls -l INSTALL_DIR/apigateway/posix/bin
   ```
4. Using the same user who owns the API Gateway binaries, unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 server Update over the `apigateway` directory in your existing installation directory . For example:

   ```
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Core_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C /opt/Axway-7.7/apigateway/
   ```
5. Change to the `apigateway` directory in your installation.

   ```
   cd INSTALL_DIR/apigateway
   ```
6. Run the post-install script, and ensure that the correct permissions are set:

   ```
   apigw_sp_post_install.sh
   ```

#### Install the Policy Studio update

To install the update on your existing Policy Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_PolicyStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Run the script as follows:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `policystudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_policy_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}} You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Policy Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_policy_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`). {{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/policystudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Policy Studio Update over the `policystudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Policy Studio with `policystudio -clean`.

If the script encounters an error, you are prompted to revert to the backup.

#### Install the Configuration Studio update

To install the update on your existing Configuration Studio installation, an update script is provided. The update script is located inside the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack (for example, `APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_ConfigurationStudio_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz`).

Run the script as follows:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh INSTALL_DIR
```

`INSTALL_DIR` is the base API Gateway 7.7 installation directory that contains the `configurationstudio` directory.

For example:

```
./update_configuration_studio.sh /opt/Axway-7.7/
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}} You must execute the update script using the same user who installed Configuration Studio.

An update script is also available for Windows. It is called `update_configuration_studio.bat` and it is located in the API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update pack for Windows (`.zip`). {{< /alert >}}

Running this script performs the following steps:

1. Back up your existing `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio` directory.
2. Remove old JRE versions by deleting the `INSTALL_DIR/configurationstudio/jre` directory.
3. Unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Configuration Studio Update over the `configurationstudio` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory.
4. Start Configuration Studio with `configurationstudio -clean`

If the script encounters an error, you are prompted to revert to the backup.

#### Install the API Gateway Analytics update

To install the update on your existing API Gateway Analytics 7.7 installation, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that your existing API Gateway Analytics instance and Node Manager have been stopped.
2. Verify the owners of API Gateway binaries before extracting the update.

   ```
   ls -l INSTALL_DIR/analytics/posix/bin
   ```
3. Using the same user who owns the API Gateway Analytics binaries, unzip and extract API Gateway 7.7 Analytics Update over the `analytics` directory in your existing API Gateway 7.7 installation directory. For example:

   ```
   tar -xzvf APIGateway_7.7.YYYYMMDD_Analytics_linux-x86-64_BNnn.tar.gz -C /opt/Axway-7.7/analytics/
   ```
4. Change to the `analytics` directory in your installation:

   ```
   cd INSTALL_DIR/analytics
   ```
5. Run the post-install script for API Gateway Analytics.

   ```
   apigw_analytics_sp_post_install.sh
   ```

You must also install an update for your existing API Gateway 7.7 server.

### After installation

The following steps apply after installing the update.

#### API Gateway

To allow an unprivileged user to run the API Gateway on a Linux system, perform the following steps:

1. Add the following line to the `INSTALL_DIR/system/conf/jvm.xml` file:

   ```
   <VMArg name="-Djava.library.path=$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64/server:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib/amd64:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib/engines:$VDISTDIR/ext/$DISTRIBUTION/lib:$VDISTDIR/ext/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/jre/lib:system/lib:$VDISTDIR/$DISTRIBUTION/lib"/>
   ```
2. Run the command `setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep cap_sys_rawio=+ep' INSTALL_DIR/platform/bin/vshell` to allow the API Gateway to listen on privileged ports.

#### API Manager

When API Manager is installed, you must run the `update-apimanager` script after the API Gateway post-install script to ensure that all paths are up-to-date.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="warning" >}} Before executing the `update-apimanager` script:

* Apply the update to all API Gateways.
* Ensure that all Node Managers and API Gateway instances are running.

{{< /alert >}}

This script updates the active deployment in the API Manager group. After running the script, you must recreate the API Manager project (common project, containing Server Settings) from the deployment, so that you will not need to revert the changes the next time you perform a project deployment.

As an alternative to recreating the API Manager project, you can deploy only your common project to a development server and run the `update-apimanager` script against it, and then create a new common project from this API Gateway instance. Finally, you must deploy your updated policies to your API Manager group.

You can run this command once at the API Gateway group level, instead of on every API Gateway instance, for example:

```
/opt/Axway-7.7/apigateway/posix/bin/update-apimanager --username=admin --password=MY_PASSWORD --group=API_MGR_GROUP
```

If the API Gateway group is protected by a passphrase, you must append the command with `--passphrase=API_MGR_GROUP_PASSPHRASE`.

The following command shows an example of running the `update-apimanager` script when the Client Application Registry is installed:

```
/opt/Axway-7.7/apigateway/posix/bin/update-apimanager --username=admin --password=MY_PASSWORD --group=API_MGR_GROUP   --productname=clientappreg
```

If the API Gateway group is protected by a passphrase, you must append the command with `--passphrase=API_MGR_GROUP_PASSPHRASE`.

## Update a container deployment

If a `fed` file is provided as part of building the API Manager container, you must follow these steps to update the `fed` with the configuration changes:

1. Install the update on a installation of the API Gateway.
2. Run the following command:

   ```
   /opt/Axway-7.7/apigateway/posix/bin/update-apimanager --fed <path to old file>.fed --oa <path to update file>.fed
   ```

You do not need to run any API Manager instances.

The `fed` now contains the updates for the API Manager configuration and can be used to build containers.
